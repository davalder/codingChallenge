            <p>You are developing a new programming language and currently working on variable names. You have a list of words that you
            consider to be good and could be used for variable names. All the strings in words consist of lowercase English letters.
            
            A complex variable name is a combination (possibly with repetitions) of some strings from words, written in CamelCase.
            In other words, all the strings are written without spaces and each string (with the possible exception of the first
            one) starts with a capital letter.
            
            Your programming language should accept complex variable names only.
            
            You need to check if the variableName is accepted by your programming language.
            
            For example for the next escenario:
            words = ["is", "valid", "right"];
            variableName = "isValid";
            solution(words, variableName); // This should be true
            variableName = "isValidAbc";
            solution(words, variableName); // This should be false
            </p>
