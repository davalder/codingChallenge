            <p>You are developing a new programming language and currently working on variable names.<br>
                You have a list of words that you consider to be good and could be used for variable names.<br>
                All the strings in words consist of lowercase English letters.<br>
                <br>
                A complex variable name is a combination (possibly with repetitions) of some strings from words,<br>
                written in CamelCase.<br>
                In other words, all the strings are written without spaces and each string (with the possible<br>
                exception of the first one) starts with a capital letter.<br>
                Your programming language should accept complex variable names only.<br>
                You need to check if the variableName is accepted by your programming language.<br>
                <br>
                For example for the next escenario:<br>
                words = ["is", "valid", "right"];<br>
                variableName = "isValid";<br>
                solution(words, variableName); // This should be true<br>
                variableName = "isValidAbc";<br>
                solution(words, variableName); // This should be false<br>
            </p>
        </div>
